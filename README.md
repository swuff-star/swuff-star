This GitHub profile is dedicated to uploading, maintaining, and showcasing my most significant works, many of which are higlighted throughout this README. Unless otherwise specified, most of this work is within the [Starstorm 2 repository](https://github.com/TeamMoonstorm/Starstorm2), a mod for Risk of Rain 2:

# Previous Modding Works (Completed / Released)

## Executioner
A playable character who focuses on chaining abilities and kills together into long streaks of violence.

![Executioner4](https://github.com/swuff-star/swuff-star/blob/main/exe-gif4.gif?raw=true)

## Nemesis Commando
A playable character who, like Commando, is a balanced fighter at all ranges while focusing on high item procs - though by unqiuely pairing a blade and a gun, rather than dual pistols.

## HUNK (Standalone)
A collaboratively made playable character who has a unique type of loot in the form of various equippable firearms that each have limited ammo and must be cycled between and upgraded as they are obtained. My contributions were in the form of implementing weapon spawns in each scene for each HUNK player, systems relating to spawning and unlocking said unique spawns, the character's 'Utility' skill, and some behavior of some elite 'virus'-type enemies.

## Follower & Wayfarer
An enemy and boss that focus on supporting other monsters rather than directly combating the player.

## Rushrum
A tiny nuisence that runs around the player, either hoping to distract them or slip in close unnoticed to attack!

## Drones & Drone Table (Lost in Transit)
Many, many, acquirable NPC followers who are capable of a variety of actions such as duplicating items or firing devastating lasers at foes. On top of this, a port of an interactable from Risk of Rain: Returns which allows 3 identical drones to be sacrified in exchange for 1 stronger drone of a similar purpose.

## Items: Field Accelerator, Hunter's Sigil, Rusty Jetpack (Lost in Transit), The Toxin (Lost in Transit)
Not the full extent of acquirable items I've implemented, though ones that felt worth showcasing due to their unique mechanics or visuals:

# Previous Modding Works (WIP)

## Ethereal Run Upgrade
A set of systems that allows a player to permanently increase the difficulty of their run while playing it, promoting longer runs as players are able to opt into more challenging gameplay in the form of increased run scaling, new stacking elite types, a new elite director, and a variety of miscellaneous effects.

## Zanzan the Faded (Scavenger Trader)
A passive NPC who can be interacted with, allowing the player to give an item in exchange for an item of similar 'value'. 'Value' is an arbitrarily designated value 0-100, reflective of item tier and a randomly generated item preference that is unique to each run. Favorite items have inflated value, potentially allowing a player to potentially bring many of a weak 'favorite' item to increase their value - though, each trade has diminishing returns.

## Pyro
A playable character who heats up the competition, managing a unique 'heat' resource that's earned and spent by various skills.

## Knight
A playable character who brawls in melee-range utilizing a traditional sword and shield, rewarding carefully timed parries with combat longevity.

## Drifter (Lost in Transit)
A collaboratively made survivor from Risk of Rain: Returns, who duels with enemies in melee range to gain scrap which can be spent on skills. I handled most of the prototype, other than the Temporary Item system.

## Bladedancer (Standalone)
A playable character that would dance between foes while fighting with a variety of bladed weapons. Made as a proof of concept to help an animator understand character setup.

## Berserker (Standalone)
A playable monster that towered over regular playable characters and many common monsters, fighting by grabbing and brutalizing smaller enemies in a variety of ways.

## MULE
A playable character who gets up close and personal, attempting to lock down enemies long enough to charge up an earth-rippling slam attack.

## Nemesis Huntress
A playable character that rewards precision and accuracy, charging and firing a bow with various arrow types that deal extra damage should they hit the enemy's head.

## Nemesis Captain
A playable character that - in loose terms - pulls a wide variety of skills from a "deck" (like cards), and can cast them fairly freely, though must manage a unique "stress" resource that is subject to debuffing the player should they fail to respect it.

## Agarthan
A komodo dragon-inspired enemy type.

# Non-Modding Works

## Risk of Rain: First Contact
A collaborative fangame that reimagines the basics of Risk of Rain 1, though redesigned from the ground up with freely aimed skills, more detailed terrain types, and enemies to fit these new mechanics. I primarily handled implementation of playable characters, monsters, and stages.

## Risk of Rain Returns: Eclipse
A small Risk of Rain Returns mod in its earliest stages that focuses on porting items from Risk of Rain 2 that are absent in Returns.
